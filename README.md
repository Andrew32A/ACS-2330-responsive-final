# User Journeys
>As a busy professional, I want to improve my typing speed and accuracy during my daily commute. I open Typing Gym on my mobile device, tap on the quote, and start typing. The virtual keyboard pops up and I feel like I'm at a real keyboard. The quotes are challenging but not too difficult, and I can see my progress over time. I appreciate that even if the API is down, I can still practice with the offline database.

>As a high school student, I want to get better at typing so I can finish my essays faster. I open Typing Gym on my laptop and select the desktop layout. I like that the quotes are randomly generated and that I can choose different levels of difficulty. The timer adds a bit of pressure which helps me focus. I also appreciate that the website gives me feedback on my mistakes so I can improve.

>As a retiree, I want to keep my mind sharp and learn something new. I discover Typing Gym and decide to try it out on my tablet. The mobile layout is easy to use and I appreciate that I don't have to download any apps. The quotes are interesting and I like that I can learn new things while practicing my typing. Even if the internet is down, I can still practice with the offline database.
